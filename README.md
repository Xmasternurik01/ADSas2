**Overview**
The objective of this project is to offer tailored versions of popular programming data structures. It includes implementations of array lists, linked lists, min heaps, queues, and stacks, complete with supporting iterator classes for easy traversal. The classes involved are MyArrayList for dynamic arrays, MyLinkedList for linked lists, MyMinHeap for min heap structures, MyQueue for queues, and MyStack for stacks. There's also a common interface, MyList, defining shared methods between MyArrayList and MyLinkedList. Additionally, iterator classes like MyArrayListIterator and MyLinkedListIterator facilitate traversal. The Main class serves as the entry point for testing functionality and handling input-output tasks.
